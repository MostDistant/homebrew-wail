# WAIL Homebrew Formula
#
# This file is the source of truth for the Homebrew formula.
# It is copied automatically to the MostDistant/homebrew-wail tap on each release.
# The `url` and `sha256` fields below are updated by the release workflow.
#
# Architecture: Go/Wails desktop app.
# The app (session orchestration, Link sync, signaling, audio) is built with Go,
# with an Ableton Link binding compiled via cgo against the vendor/link submodule.
#
# To install:
#   brew tap MostDistant/wail
#   brew install MostDistant/wail/wail

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The WAIL Send / WAIL Receive CLAP plugins were built but not copied into your DAW plugin folder
      (Homebrew can't write there). Install them with:
        wail-install-plugins
      Then rescan plugins in your DAW. You only need them for DAWs without native
      Ableton Link Audio (Live 12.3+ needs no plugin).
